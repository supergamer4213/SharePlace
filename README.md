# SharePlace
## Inspiration
I was inspired by the idea that it would be fun and interesting to create a social platform where people can share their favorite summer activities and places in their city. Places like the Statue of Liberty, their favorite restaurant, or their favorite park.

## What it does
When a user enters the page it charges a series of posts from a database. Then the user can read the post created by other people or create their own post. If the user wants to create a new post, the user will need to fill a form that asks about the place or activity name, city, description, link from google maps, and image. All this data is then sent to the backend and then stored in the database with the other posts.

## How I built it
To create the website I used a diverse set of tools, frameworks and libraries.
I used Visual Studio Code as IDE.
I used Express.js to create the backend and APIs.
I used React.js to create the frontend.
I used MongoDB as database.
I used Redux to manage React.js states.
I used mongoose as connection and data modeling of the database.
I used Heroku to host the backend and Netlify to host the frontend.

## Challenges I ran into
I ran into a lot of problems and challenges including problems with the backend, frontend, database, and hosting. I think the largest challenge I confronted was to learn almost everything needed to know about web development in two days.

## Why I am proud of my project
I am really proud of my project even if I do not win. Because I had a lot of fun doing this and I have exceed all of my limits. I never imagined that I could build something so complex. This was my first Hackathon and I feel that I made a great job.

## What we learned
I learned a lot about web development, tools, frameworks and libraries. But this Hackathon also taught me about Determination, because this is the first time I spend all of my time and effort into something. And I am proud of how it ended.

## What's next for SharePlace
I think that in the future I will upgrade the ui, add a search bar, add a city filter and even an interacting map that show all the activities on the database.
